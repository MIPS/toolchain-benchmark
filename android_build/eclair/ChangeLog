external/icu4c/common/cstring.icu4c.h
  Rename cstring.h to cstring.icu4c.h. There is a header file named as
  CString.h in webcore source tree. When compiled by rvct under windows,
  #include "CString.h" can match both files, but rvct always includes the
  wrong file. Since cstring.h is not widely used, I renamed it to
  cstring.icu4c.h. If we found any new benchmarks use this file, we should
  revert this CL and look for better method.
